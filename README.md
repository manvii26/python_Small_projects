# python_Small_projects
A collection of small Python projects built while learning core programming concepts.

This repository is a collection of beginner to intermediate Python mini projects created as part of my learning journey.

# The projects focus on:
- Logic building
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and modular code
- Using built-in Python modules (random, turtle, etc.)
